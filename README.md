The goal of this project was to identify emotions based on facial expressions in images. 
We employed various machine learning models including SVM, RandomForest, KNN, and deep learning models such as CNN and ResNet50 for emotion classification. Additionally, we used PCA for dimensionality reduction and 
GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance. 
A real-time emotion detection pipeline was also developed, incorporating landmark detection, feature extraction, and prediction to enable efficient and accurate emotion recognition.

Requirements: numpy, pandas, cv2, matplotlib, face_recognition & sklear
